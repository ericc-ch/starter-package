Use pnpm as package manager.

Run `pnpm run check` after completing a task.

Node.js can run `.ts` (see `package.json`) files directly (no need for ts-node or tsx or compilation etc).

# References Directory

The `.references/` directory contains shallow clones of important external repositories.
Never make any changes in this directory, it is ignored by git and meant as reference only.

Prefer exploring and reading this directory over searching for documentation. Think of it as the source of truth.

Available references:

- opencode - OpenCode
- opentui - OpenTUI
- dbus-native - Homebridge's fork of dbus-native
- effect-smol - Effect v4
